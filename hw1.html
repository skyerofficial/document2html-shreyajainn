<p>They were followed by the larger iPhone 6, with models featuring 4.7 and 5.5-inch displays.</p>
<p>The iPhone 6S was introduced the following year,</p>
<p>which featured hardware upgrades and support for pressure-sensitive touch inputs,</p>
<p>as well as the SEâ€”which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S.</p>
<p><u>In 2016, Apple unveiled the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus,</u> which add water resistance, improved system and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the
Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5 mm headphone jack found on previous models. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus were released in 2017,
adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera.<i> The iPhone X was released alongside the 8 and 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less
    design, an improved camera and a new facial recognition system, named Face ID, but having no home button, and therefore, no Touch ID.</i></p>
